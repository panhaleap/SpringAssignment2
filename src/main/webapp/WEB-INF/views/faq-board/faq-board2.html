							It is a long established fact that a reader will be 
							distracted by the readable content of a page when looking 
							at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it 
							has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed
							to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.

				            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum
							is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of 
							classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
							2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
							at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one
							of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from 
							a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites 
							of the word in classical literature, discovered the
							undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 
							1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
							(The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. 
							This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
							during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem 
							ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
							The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is 
							reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 
							1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are 
							also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied 
							by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

				            There are many variations of passages of Lorem
							Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some
							form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look
							even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of
							Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing
							hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on
							the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,
							making this the first true generator on the Internet. It 
							uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful
							of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
							reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from
							repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
